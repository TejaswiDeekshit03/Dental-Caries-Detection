# Dental-Caries-Detection
Deep learning model to detect early-stage tooth decay using the available dataset and to compare different algorithms and architectures.
Problem Definition:
There is no reversible solution for the dental cavities formed. Once it has reached the inner dentin layer of a tooth, we have to remove the damaged area by performing a filling procedure. To prevent teeth from decaying, our Artificial Intelligence-based equipment can provide the solution, which will detect these cavities early and help prevent them without using any expensive method.
 
Problem Objective:
Objectives of our Project include, but are not limited to:
·   	To provide early detection of tooth decay.
·   	To replace laser fluorescence, a dental caries detection device, with the project.
·   	To make it user-friendly regardless of where the user is.

Methodology:
Capturing teeth photos through an Android phone 
Checking if teeth are clearly visible through deep learning model one 
Sending pictures to the trained deep learning model to check for caries
Model two will process the photos and return the result 
The application will display the probability of caries 

Technology:
We will use a variety of technologies :
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) - Algorithm for developing the deep learning model 
Keras, Tensorflow - Python libraries for creating the deep learning model 
Kotlin - Language for developing Android applications.
Firebase - To store database in Android application

Functional specification (Deliverables):
Android application will be used to detect caries
The probability of cavity will be displayed in the application with the use of caries 

Project scope:
A user-friendly and easily accessible application to check for caries, which offers affordable dental check-up for caries
A heavily scalable application that can be made available for the masses, since it is free to use
